The primary objective of this project was to design a Lego robot with the mission of navigating within a confined area, gathering all the table tennis balls while evading obstacles, and ultimately delivering the collected balls through one of the two goals.

In my role for this project, I developed a script that utilized the opencv-python library to effectively distinguish between various objects using their color. This script processes incoming coordinate data from the objects, constantly updating the information to ensure accurate tracking and collection.
